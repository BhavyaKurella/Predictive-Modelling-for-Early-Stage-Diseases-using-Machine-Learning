This research investigates the classification of brain tumours from MRI images using deep learning models to improve diagnostic accuracy and support early detection in clinical practice. Brain tumours, if detected late, often lead to poor patient outcomes, and traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on radiologist expertise, which can be time-consuming and prone to variability. This study utilises the publicly available brain_tumor_detection dataset from Hugging Face and implements BrainTumorCNN, ResNet18, and MobileNetV2 to classify images as tumour or non-tumour. Preprocessing steps include resizing images, normalising pixel values, and applying augmentation to enhance model generalisation. Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC were used for performance evaluation. BrainTumorCNN achieved the highest results across all metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score ~1.0; ROC-AUC = 1.00), although the near-perfect performance suggests potential overfitting due to dataset size. ResNet18 and MobileNetV2 delivered slightly lower but more generalisable results, achieving Accuracy between 98â€“99% and ROC-AUC above 0.98. Feature interpretability through SHAP visualisations identified critical MRI regions influencing predictions, increasing clinical trust in AI outputs. While deep learning models proved highly effective, the study highlights the importance of balancing model complexity with dataset size to avoid overfitting. Overall, the research provides a comparative framework for selecting optimal brain tumour classification models and offers methodological insights for developing reliable AI-assisted diagnostic tools in healthcare.
